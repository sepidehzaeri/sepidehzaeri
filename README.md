- 👋 Hi, I’m @sepidehzaeri
- 👀I’m passionate about genetics, bioinformatics, and research that contributes to advancements in health, sustainability, and innovation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux, clinical research, and improving the usage of Bioinformatic tools to analyze mRNA and gene expression. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on researchers who are working on clinical research. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You could email me at sepideh_z20@yahoo.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a deep love for classic cars—they’re more than just vehicles to me; they’re time machines.
-   Every time I get behind the wheel of one, it feels like I’m transported back to a bygone era, where life was simpler, style was timeless, and the open road carried a sense of adventure.
-   There’s nothing quite like the hum of an old engine and the charm of vintage design to make me feel connected to the past while fully enjoying the moment.
